# Variational Autoencoders

This repository is aimed to practice with Variatonial Autoencoders to model complex distributions and making generative models. 

This repository is based in the following paper: [*Tutorial on Variational Autoencoders*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.05908). That paper offers a [repository](https://github.com/cdoersch/vae_tutorial)  where we can find a code for a VAE example for the MNIST dataset. Nevertheless, in this repository we'll build a VAE class only for practicing our coding abiities and get a deeper understanding. After that, we'll compare our results with a VAE coded with packages such as `caffe` or `PyTorch`. Additionaly, we will add a more mathematical explanaiton of the *Variational Bayesian* theory and how is used in this models.

I hope this repository helps anyoene in their path on untherstanding *Variational Bayesian* models and VAEs.
